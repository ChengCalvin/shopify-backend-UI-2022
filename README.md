# Shopify Backend (UI) Challenge Winter 2022

This project is the frontend tool used to demonstrate the API endpoint build in the backend github repository which can be found here: (https://github.com/ChengCalvin/shopify-backend-challenge-2022). The webpage is a simple UI that allows the user to search for the image stored in the backend by the type of search. The current UI is very simple and can be improved if given the time.

## To run this project

To run this project you just need to do `npm install` followed by `npm run start` as well as the server in the github link above

## Idea

The idea behind this project was to first populate a `NoSQL` database to build a search function which allows the user to search by `characteristics`, `text`, and `image url`. The frontend was built to demonstrate the functionality of the backend.

## Features

The current features allowed on the frontend is the ability to search for images stored in the backend. More features can be added such as the `ADD` and `DELETE` functionality to add pictures to a saved list and to delete it.
